### RSI Rules (SMA-9 & WMA-45 on RSI)
- **Regime (filter):** Use WMA-45( RSI ) slope + SMA-9 position vs WMA-45.
  - Long bias if SMA-9 > WMA-45 and WMA-45 is rising; short bias if SMA-9 < WMA-45 and WMA-45 is falling.
- **Trigger:** In long bias, wait RSI pullback ~40–50 then cross **up** SMA-9; in short bias, wait RSI bounce ~50–60 then cross **down** SMA-9.
- **Management:** Scale out near RSI 70–80 (long) / 20–30 (short) when momentum slows; full exit on SMA-9 × WMA-45 cross-back or loss of 40/60 anchors.
- **Notes:** Avoid trades when RSI hovers in 40–60 and the two MA lines braid (sideways). Always confirm with price structure (HH/HL vs LL/LH) and higher-TF bias.
