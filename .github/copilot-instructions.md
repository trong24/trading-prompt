## Common Patterns to Follow

### Formula Presentation
```markdown
**Position Size Calculation**:
```
Position Size = (Account Risk %) √ó (Total Account) √∑ (Stop Loss Distance)
```

**Example**: 
- Account: $50,000
- Risk: 2% = $1,000
- Stop loss: $5 per share
- Position Size: $1,000 √∑ $5 = 200 shares
```

### Warning Callouts
```markdown
‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk Warning**: Never risk more than you can afford to lose. This example is for educational purposes only.
```

### Key Insight Boxes
```markdown
üí° **Key Insight**: The best trades often feel uncomfortable at entry because they go against the crowd.
```

### Cross-References
```markdown
üìñ **See Also**: [Module 04: Risk Management](module04_risk_management.md) for detailed position sizing strategies.
```
